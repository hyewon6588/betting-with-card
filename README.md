# betting-with-card

This is a game about decision-making.

First, you'll fill in the form about your information(name, age, and sex) and number of trials you want.

After less than 8 seconds of fixation to focus on the screen,
you'll see 2 cards. One will be exposed its number and the other will be not.

You'll bet either $5 or $20 on the number of the exposed card is bigger than the hidden.

Then the number of hidden card will be shown.

If the exposed deck is bigger, you'll earn what you bet.
If the hidden one is bigger, you'll lose the (virtual)money.
If both cards are tie, you'll get(or lose) none.

After you finish all trials, you can see the result on text file.
